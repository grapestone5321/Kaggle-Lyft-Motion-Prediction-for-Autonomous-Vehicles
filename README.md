# Kaggle-Lyft-Motion-Prediction-for-Autonomous-Vehicles
Kaggle-Featured Code Competition




# Task
### In this competition, youâ€™ll apply your data science skills to build motion prediction models for self-driving vehicles. 

### You'll have access to the largest Prediction Dataset ever released to train and test your models. 

### Your knowledge of machine learning will then be required to predict how cars, cyclists,and pedestrians move in the AV's environment.

# Data

### The dataset is structured as follows:       
        scenes,   aerial_map,   semantic_map
   ### Under scenes, we have:
        sample.zarr,   test.zarr,   train.zarr,   validate.zarr,   mask.npz *   
   ### Each .zarr file contains a set of:
        scenes,   frames,   agents,   traffic_light_faces,   agents_mask**  
 
  *:   In test, the mask (provided in files as mask.npz) masks out any test object for which predictions are NOT required.
  
**:   A mask that (for train and validation) masks out objects that aren't useful for training.       




### Files:
- aerial_map - an aerial map used when rasterisation is performed with mode "py_satellite"
- semantic_map - a high definition semantic map used when rasterisation is performed with mode "py_semantic"
- sample.zarr - a small sample set, designed for exploration
- train.zarr - the training set, in .zarr format
- validate.zarr - a validation set (roughly the size of train)
- test.csv - the test set, in .zarr format
- mask.npz - a boolean mask for the test set. All and only the agents included in the mask should be submitted
- *sample_submission.csv - two sample submissions, one in multi-mode format, the other in single-mode

## Issue --- Takes much time to compute (>9 hours)
-> W/ kaggle notebook is required in Testing/Prediction

### ideas:
-> Separate Training from Testing/Prediction

-> W/O kaggle notebook in Training
